We take in 3 parameters root, p, and q. If the current node root is none or equal to p or q it returns root. This case handles if p and q are found in the same tree. If p and q are on the left and right subtree, then it checks recursively if left and right is none. If left and right are both none then it means p and q are in different subtrees and the lowest common ancestor is the current root.
